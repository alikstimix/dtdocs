This view allows you to print your images. 

Darktable only scans for printers at startup, so your target printer must be active when darktable starts in order to provide the print module with the target printer's ICC profile. 

The first step is to select an image in the [lighttable view](../lighttable/_index.md), then switch to the print view. The selected image will be displayed in the centre panel and the [print settings](../module-reference/utility-modules/print/print-settings.md) module will now allow you to adjust printer settings and initiate printing.

The [filmstrip](../module-reference/utility-modules/shared/filmstrip.md) at the bottom of the screen is active and you can drag-and-drop more images into the centre panel ready for printing.
